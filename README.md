# TO-DO-App-using-integration-of-Django-REST-framework-and-AJAX
This is a To-Do app with the Django REST Framework. I have built REST API's with the Django REST Framework.  With the help of DRF, I have serialized data along with CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE functionality.  To handle the front end I have used vanilla JavaScript and AJAX.
